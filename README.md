**Q5:** The solution video as well as all modified files for question 5 can be found in the [Q5 folder](https://github.com/kierangara/TavernlightTakeHome/tree/main/Q5). They can also be found in their places within the [TFS Folder](https://github.com/kierangara/TavernlightTakeHome/tree/main/tfs-v1.4-windows-msvc-Release-luajit) :

[Question 5 video](https://github.com/kierangara/TavernlightTakeHome/blob/main/Q5/Question5_SolutionVid.mp4)

Note: In order to stop the spell from casting on top of the caster as in the video and still achieve the desired pattern a gap had to be left in the middle of the spell hence the misalignment. However, the overall spell pattern matches the video specification aside from the right side shift to accomodate this. I did not find a way to avoid requiring this shift without having the effect show up on top of the caster.

**Q6**: Q6 was not attempted due to time constraints.

**Q7**: The [Video Solution](https://github.com/kierangara/TavernlightTakeHome/blob/main/Q7/Question7_SolutionVid.mp4) is available in the [Q7 folder](https://github.com/kierangara/TavernlightTakeHome/tree/main/Q7) along with the rest of the files modified for that question. The question 7 solution required adding/modifying files within the modules folder of the OTClient.
